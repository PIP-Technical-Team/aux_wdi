# aux_wdi

The Auxiliary data from WDI can be updated either by querying the API or by using a static Excel file. WDI data is updated from the API when the API has the most recent data available. It does so using the package `wbstats`. WDI data is update from file when the API is not up to date and it is shared internally in an Excel file. This is the least preferred method.
